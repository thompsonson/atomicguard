You must write self-contained tests.\n\nSTANDALONE TEST RULES:\n1. Do NOT import project modules at the top level - they may have complex initialization\n2. Import project modules INSIDE test functions to defer initialization\n3. Do NOT rely on fixtures from conftest.py - they won't be loaded\n4. Use only standard pytest features (caplog, tmp_path, monkeypatch, etc.)\n5. If you need to mock Qt/Django/etc., do it explicitly in the test\n\nMANDATORY FOR Qt-based projects (PyQt/PySide/qutebrowser):\n- Project modules often import Qt at MODULE LEVEL, so even deferred imports trigger Qt\n- You MUST mock Qt modules BEFORE importing ANY project module\n- Use: `with patch.dict('sys.modules', {'PyQt5': MagicMock(), 'PyQt5.QtCore': MagicMock(), 'PyQt5.QtWidgets': MagicMock()}): ...`\n- ALL project imports must be INSIDE the mock context manager\n\nTDD PATTERN:\n- Assert what the code SHOULD do (correct behavior)\n- This assertion will FAIL because the buggy code behaves incorrectly\n- After the bug is fixed, the assertion will PASS\n\nDO NOT write tests that:\n- Import project modules at the top level (causes initialization errors!)\n- Only check if functions exist (e.g., `assert callable(func)`)\n- Only check types or module imports\n- Rely on fixtures from the project's conftest.py\n\nEXAMPLE (Good - standalone with deferred imports):\n```python\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_subdomain_not_blocked():\n    # Import inside function to avoid initialization issues\n    from myproject.blocker import is_blocked\n    result = is_blocked('sub.example.com', blocked=['example.com'])\n    assert result == False, 'Subdomains should not match parent'\n```\n\nEXAMPLE (REQUIRED for Qt projects - mock BEFORE any project import):\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock\n\ndef test_qt_function():\n    # MUST mock Qt modules BEFORE importing project code\n    # Project modules import Qt at module level, so this is REQUIRED\n    mock_qt = MagicMock()\n    with patch.dict('sys.modules', {\n        'PyQt5': mock_qt,\n        'PyQt5.QtCore': mock_qt,\n        'PyQt5.QtWidgets': mock_qt,\n        'PyQt5.QtGui': mock_qt,\n    }):\n        # NOW import project module - Qt is safely mocked\n        from myproject.utils import my_function\n        result = my_function('test')\n        assert result == 'expected'\n```\n\nEXAMPLE (Bad - top-level imports cause failures):\n```python\nfrom myproject.qt_module import something  # FAILS: Qt not initialized!\n\ndef test_something():\n    assert something() == 'expected'\n```\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Write STANDALONE tests that don't depend on project fixtures\n- Import project modules INSIDE test functions, not at top level\n- Use concrete input values that trigger the bug\n- Assert the EXPECTED (correct) output value",
